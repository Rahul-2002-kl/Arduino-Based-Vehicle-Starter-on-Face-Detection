Title: Arduino Based Vehicle Starter on Face Detection

🚗🔒 This project is an Arduino-based vehicle starter with face detection for enhanced security.
👤✅ The ignition starts only for authorized users, while intruders trigger real-time Telegram alerts with photos.
⚡ Integrated with OpenCV, Haarcascade, and LBPH, it provides a cost-effective and reliable anti-theft system.

📖 Description

This project implements an Arduino-based vehicle ignition system using face detection to prevent unauthorized access and vehicle theft. The system uses OpenCV with Haarcascade and LBPH algorithms for real-time face recognition, ensuring only authorized users can start the vehicle. In case of an intruder, the system sends a Telegram alert with the captured photo to the owner, along with an option for remote access approval. It also integrates an accident detection module for enhanced safety, making it a secure and cost-effective solution for modern vehicle security.

🎯 Objectives

Prevent vehicle theft using face recognition authentication.

Use Haarcascade algorithm and LBPH for face recognition.

Provide real-time alerts via Telegram.

Enable remote authorization in case of emergency.


⚙️ Methodology

Camera captures the image of the driver.

Image is converted into grayscale and processed using OpenCV.

Haarcascade classifier checks for a face match in the local dataset.

If matched → Vehicle ignition ON.

If not matched → Telegram alert with intruder’s photo.

Owner can approve/deny access with password.
