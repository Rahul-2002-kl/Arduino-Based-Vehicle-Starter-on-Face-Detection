Title: Arduino Based Vehicle Starter on Face Detection

🚗🔒 This project is an Arduino-based vehicle starter with face detection for enhanced security.
👤✅ The ignition starts only for authorized users, while intruders trigger real-time Telegram alerts with photos.
⚡ Integrated with OpenCV, Haarcascade, and LBPH, it provides a cost-effective and reliable anti-theft system.

📖 Description

This project implements a vehicle anti-theft and smart ignition system using Arduino and face detection technology.The vehicle starts only when an authorized user’s face is detected. If an unauthorized person attempts to start the vehicle:

The system denies ignition Sends the intruder’s photo to the owner via Telegram alert Provides an option for the owner to remotely approve ignition using a password system This enhances vehicle security and reduces theft risks.


🎯 Objectives

Prevent vehicle theft using face recognition authentication.

Use Haarcascade algorithm and LBPH for face recognition.

Provide real-time alerts via Telegram.

Enable remote authorization in case of emergency.


⚙️ Methodology

Camera captures the image of the driver.

Image is converted into grayscale and processed using OpenCV.

Haarcascade classifier checks for a face match in the local dataset.

If matched → Vehicle ignition ON.

If not matched → Telegram alert with intruder’s photo.

Owner can approve/deny access with password.


🔧 Hardware Used

Arduino UNO

Camera Module

Accident Sensor Module

LCD Display

Relay Module

Johnson Motor


💻 Software Used

Arduino IDE (for microcontroller programming)

OpenCV (Python) for face detection & recognition

Python IDE for running scripts
